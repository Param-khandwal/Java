// 10. Define a class of type Distance that has Feet and Inches as members. 
// -Define a function that adds two Distances passed as argument and returns 
// the sum as another Distance object. 

// -Place the class in a package named user.own.pack . Compile and run the 
// java file using console (javac and java utility). 

// -Write a program that imports this package and uses class to find the sum 
// of two distances.
